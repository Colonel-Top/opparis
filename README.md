# opparis

This is the development github page for #opparis-dev on irc.anonops.com

To get started go ahead and install docker on the platform of your choice and run 

`docker run -it kernelzeroday/opparis bash`

and 

`cd /isis/opparis`

We are located on #opparis-dev irc.anonops.com

there are a lot of tools installed on the docker image and it is being updated regularly as the prefered environment for scripts and tools to be run in because it has all dependancies and packages you may need. 

to connect to anonops from inside the docker image simply type `anonops`

Thanks!
